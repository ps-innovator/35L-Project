UCLAX

Our idea, UCLAX, is to develop an app serving UCLA students, that helps Bruins find other Bruins to split a ride to/from LAX with, based on travel schedule.

Running the Project:
1. Ensure you are in the 35L-Project directory
2. Navigate into the backend directory with "cd uclax-backend"
3. Create an ".env" file and insert the provided information using the format below
4. Run "npm install" to download necessary packages for the backend
5. Start the backend using "node index.js"
6. Return to the 35L-Project directory with cd .. 
7. Navigate into the frontend directory with "cd uclax-frontend"
8. run "npm install" to download necessary packages for the frontend
9. Start the frontend using "npm run dev"

The .env file should be of the following format:

UNAME=...

PASSWD=...

SECRET=...
